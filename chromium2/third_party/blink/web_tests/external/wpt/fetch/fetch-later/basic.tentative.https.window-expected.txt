This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL fetchLater() cannot be called without request. assert_throws_js: function "() => fetchLater()" threw object "ReferenceError: fetchLater is not defined" ("ReferenceError") expected instance of function "function TypeError() { [native code] }" ("TypeError")
FAIL fetchLater()'s return tells the deferred request is not yet sent. fetchLater is not defined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
