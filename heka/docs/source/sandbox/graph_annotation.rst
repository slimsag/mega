Circular Buffer Graph Annotation (Alerts)
=========================================
This plugin detects anomalies in the data.  When an anomaly is detected an
alert is generated and the graph is visually annotated at the time of the
alert. See `dygraphs Annotations <http://dygraphs.com/annotations.html>`_
for the available annotation properties.
