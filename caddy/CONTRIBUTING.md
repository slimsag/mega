## Contributing to Caddy

**[Join us on Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/caddy/)** to chat with other Caddy developers! ([Request an invite](http://bit.ly/go-slack-signup), then join the #caddy channel.)

This project gladly accepts contributions and we encourage interested users to get involved!


#### For small tweaks, bug fixes, and tests

Submit [pull requests](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/pulls) at any time. Thank you for helping out in simple ways! Bug fixes should be under test to assert correct behavior.


#### Ideas, questions, bug reports

You should totally [open an issue](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues) with your ideas, questions, and bug reports, if one does not already exist for it. Bug reports should state expected behavior and contain clear instructions for reproducing the problem.


#### New features

Before submitting a pull request, please open an issue first to discuss it and claim it. This prevents overlapping efforts and keeps the project in-line with its goals. If you prefer to discuss the feature privately, you can reach other developers on Slack or you may email me directly. (My email address is below.)

And don't forget to write tests for new features!


#### Vulnerabilities

If you've found a vulnerability that is serious, please email me: Matthew dot Holt at Gmail. If it's not a big deal, a pull request will probably be faster.


## Thank you

Thanks for your help! Caddy would not be what it is today without your contributions.
