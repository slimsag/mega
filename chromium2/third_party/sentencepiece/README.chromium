Description:
SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for
Neural Network-based text generation systems where the vocabulary size is
predetermined prior to the neural model training. SentencePiece implements
subword units (e.g., byte-pair-encoding (BPE) [Sennrich et al.]) and unigram
language model [Kudo.]) with the extension of direct training from raw
sentences. SentencePiece allows us to make a purely end-to-end system that does
not depend on language-specific pre/postprocessing.

Making new patches:
1. git commit changes, be sure to write a helpful commit message
2. Run `git format-patch -o third_party/sentencepiece/patches/ origin/main third_party/sentencepiece/src/`

Patches:
* rename_version.patch - Renames the src/VERSION file because otherwise C++
includes of the form `#include <version>` will find that text file instead of
the header they are meant to find.

* remove-dart-exceptions.patch - Removes all try/catch blocks and changes
`DART_THROW` to `ABSL_CHECK(false)` to be compatible with chromium which is
built with exceptions disabled.
