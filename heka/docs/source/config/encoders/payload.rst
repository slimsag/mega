Payload Encoder
===============

Plugin Name: **PayloadEncoder**

The PayloadEncoder simply extracts the payload from the provided Heka message
and converts it into a byte stream for delivery to an external resource.

.. _payloadencoder_settings:

Config:

- append_newlines (bool, optional):
	Specifies whether or not a newline character (i.e. `\n`) will be appended
	to the captured message payload before serialization. Defaults to true.

- prefix_ts (bool, optional):
	Specifies whether a timestamp will be prepended to the captured message
	payload before serialization. Defaults to false.

- ts_from_message (bool, optional):
	If true, the prepended timestamp will be extracted from the message that
	is being processed. If false, the prepended timestamp will be generated by
	the system clock at the time of message processing. Defaults to true. This
	setting has no impact if `prefix_ts` is set to false.

- ts_format (string, optional): Specifies the format that should be used for
	prepended timestamps, using the standard `strftime string format
	<http://strftime.net/>`_. Defaults to ``[%Y/%b/%d:%H:%M:%S %z]``. If the
	specified format string does not end with a space character, then a space
	will be inserted between the formatted timestamp and the payload.

Example

.. code-block:: ini

	[PayloadEncoder]
	append_newlines = false
	prefix_ts = true
	ts_format = "%Y/%m/%d %l:%M:%S%p %Z"
