caption: Enable search in a anonymous mode
default: false
desc: |-
  This policy lets admins control how Google processes user data sent to Search through <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> features.
  When the policy is enabled, the user will be able to use the <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph> Launcher search box, and the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> Browser address box in <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME">$2<ex>Google ChromeOS</ex></ph>, such that the user's search history won't be linked to their identity.
  When the policy is unset or disabled, the user's data from these searches will be linked to their identity.
