# Interop Tests

This directory contains a set of tests which ensure the attribution logic as
implemented matches the intended behavior of the Attribution Reporting API.

See https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/ for the draft specification.

See //content/browser/attribution_reporting/attribution_interop_unittest.cc
for the tests.

These tests are purposefully not implemented as web platform tests, so that
they can be shared by non-web-based platforms.

The tests here cover how the browser will handle various series of sources and
triggers with different configurations, but does not rely on any blink APIs.

The vendor-specific parameters can be configured for testing. The default
configuration is specified in `default_config.json` that is contained in this
directory. Each test file can optionally specify the parameters in the
"api_config" field.

# Configuration format

The JSON schema is as follows. All the fields are required in "default_config.json"
and optional in "api_config" field. See the schema in "default_config.json".

# Test case format

The JSON schema is as follows. Timestamps must be distinct across all sources
and triggers.
