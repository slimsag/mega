Description:
The Android NDK provides libraries and tools necessary for building, running,
and debugging C/C++ on Android. However, as Chromium builds its own toolchain,
this directory only contains the simpleperf scripts and sysroot from the NDK.
This allows us to build and run tracing scripts and limits our dependencies.

Local Modifications:
* Removed files in the sysroot that conflict with other files when unzipped on
  case-insensitive filesystems (e.g. usr/include/netfilter/xt_CONNMARK.h).
